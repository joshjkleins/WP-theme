				<span>What if I want to update my site content?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				We create the website in a dynamic way where updating static information is very quick and easy.  Just send us an email and we will update it for you as soon as we can.  If you're up for it we can even train you how to operate your website to make quick on the fly changes in case that's what the business calls for.

				<span>How much does this cost?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				A one time fee to create the website of $500-$700, depending on the size of the site, and a monthly hosting fee of $150.  The only additional cost would come with a major update request such as a redesign or adding additional functionality.

				<span>Can I have a say in the site content and design?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				Absolutely! We want to hear what information you want conveyed on the site and if you want any specific images or sections we are open to discuss.  However, one of the reasons we offer such low costs is because many of our sections are pre made in a way that is very easy to put together quickly and dynamically, so a completely new section, additional functionality, or specific design requests may incur additional costs.

				<span>How do you handle the domain name?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				We will work with you to figure out the perfect fit for a domain name.  If you already have one purchased, that's great you've saved us a step! If not then we can either purchase it and get reimbursed or walk you through the steps of purchasing it yourself.  Domain names require yearly fees so we can either bill you yearly or you can handle that part yourself.

				<span>What sites don't you do?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				Our preference is static sites for small to medium business/organizations.  We just want to help out the less tech savvy and people who know a website shouldn't cost them tens of thousands of dollars a year. If you're looking for the next web app, an ecommerce site or any other software that isn't just a good ol website, then we most likely aren't for you. But we are always open for discussion!

				<span>What software is used?</span>
				<div class="dropdown"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="faq-content hide">
				Nothing too fancy, we will install a custom theme on Wordpress.  Wordpress has a very user friendly backend admin.  We want to empower those who want to be able to use and control their site and build the sites in a way where you can use a username and password to login and make small changes on your own, if that is your preference.
