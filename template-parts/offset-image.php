		<div class="content">We are here to build easy to use websites for small businesses and partner with you to build an introductory web presence showcasing your brand, what you do and who you are.  Our goal is to provide affordable and fast options for businesses who don't want (or need) the accomodies of a large website and who are not savvy in web development.  Using the Wordpress platform we will build you a website with page speeds and responsiveness as top priorities. You will provide input such as logos, domain names, images you want featured and information you want prioritized. From there we will get to work developing a website to meet your needs, getting you up and running within weeks.</div>
